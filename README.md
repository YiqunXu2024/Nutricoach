##  Quick Start

### Backend Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Initialize database:
```bash
python init_db.py
```

3. Start FastAPI service:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install Flutter dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend/app
flutter pub get
```

2. Launch Flutter application:
```bash
flutter run
```

##  Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flutter 3.0+
- OpenAI API Key (or alternative AI backend)

##  Configuration

Configure in `backend/main.py`:
- OpenAI API Key
- Database connection
- AI model selection (OpenAI/Ollama/HuggingFace)

##  Usage Instructions

1. **Register/Login**: Create an account or login to existing account
2. **Complete Profile**: Fill in health information such as height, weight, goals, etc.
3. **Record Meals**: Describe food in natural language to get nutrition analysis
4. **View Recommendations**: Get dietary advice based on personal circumstances
5. **Historical Review**: View historical meal records and nutrition trends

##  Key Innovations

- **Natural Language Processing**: Supports flexible food descriptions in multiple languages
- **Multi-AI Backend Support**: Compatible with OpenAI, Ollama, and HuggingFace models
- **Personalized AI Advice**: Generates recommendations based on individual health profiles
- **Real-time Nutrition Analysis**: Instant processing and feedback for user inputs
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Runs on iOS and Android devices

##  Research Validation
